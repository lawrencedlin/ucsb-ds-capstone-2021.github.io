    "The Sansum Diabetes Research Institute is located in Santa Barbara, California. It is dedicated to improving the lives of people impacted by diabetes through research, education, and care. SDRI has been at the forefront of helping to improve the lives of people living with diabetes since 1944 through its research. SDRI has also supported newly diagnosed diabetic patients and those who have lived with diabetes for a long period of time by providing classes ranging from nutrition, exercise, and healthy living. Furthermore, SDRI cares for people with diabetes in specialized areas such as pediatrics and diabetes during pregnancy.\n"

    "The vision of the Mil Familias Program is to reduce dramatically the burden of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke among Latino families in the United States. Bilingual, specially trained community health workers who are knowledgeable about type 2 diabetes (Especialistas) have interacted with families to collect data, answer questions, and connect families to the appropriate resources. Every year for 10 years, more than 100 variables will be measured for each family member using surveys, physical exams, lab tests, and wearable activity monitors. The information that families contribute are then placed in a database about Latino health, behavior, lifestyle, and environment. Based on the data, Mil Familias then plans to intervene in the areas of education, prevention, technology, policy, treatment, and more.\n",
